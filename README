|          SFM-1L Semtech SX1278 firmware for STM8S003						  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This firmware currently supports the following Semtech LoRa product:
	- SX1278
		- LoRa modem (application default)

1. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SFM-1L is a LoRa module made by China. It is embedded with Semtech SX1278 LoRa chip. It still needs external MCU. So in this project I ported the LoRa radio driver onto STM8L-Discovery.  	

2. Version history
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1.0.0> - This is original project from STM which SX1278 radio driver is not ported.

<2.0.0> - Port SX1276 LoRa radio driver.

<3.0.0> - Add task.c into project. So RF module can send message then another one can receive it and display it through UART.

<3.1.0> - Enable hardware SPI to improve RX/TX performance. Also fix bug for task.

<3.2.0> 
- Change name of project as "STM8L152C6".
- Increase UART baud rate to 128000.

<3.3.0> 
- Change LoRa signal bandwidth from 10.4KHz to 500KHz to improve the response time.
- Disable some functions to save code space.
